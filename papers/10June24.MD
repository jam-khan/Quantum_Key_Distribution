Paper: CONSTANT-SIZED ROBUST SELF-TESTS FOR STATES AND MEASUREMENTS OF UNBOUNDED DIMENSION

Abstract:
Paper shows that the correlations Pn,x robustly self-test the underlying states and measurements. How? Changing group-theoretic Gowers-Hatami based approach to more natural algebraic framework.

For n = 4, the correlations Pn,x self-test the maximally entangled state of every odd dimension as well as 2-outcome projective measurements of arbitrarily high rank.



What are self-testing methods?
Inferring quantum mechanical description of a device from classical observations (measurement statistics).

## PROOF of What?
Quantum Strategies constructed from projections which sum up to some particular scalar times identity can be robustly self-tested from the quantum correlations that they induce.
