# Quantum Key Distribution Research

This is the repository for all the calculations done during my research internship at the Quantum Information and Computation Lab at the University of Hong Kong.

Here are a few calculations done:
1. Probability Distribution Calculation for Quantum Correlations.
2. Optimization to find a Bell Inequality using CVXPY.
3. Guessing Probability for the Bell Expression using QuantumNPA.jl library.
4. Finding SOS decompositions of the Bell Inequality to prove the self-testing.
